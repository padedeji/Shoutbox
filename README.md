The instructions for this project were to create "a simple application that allows people to add comments or write journal entries. It can allow comments or not and timestamps for all entries. Could also be made into a shout box. Optional: Deploy it on Google App Engine or Heroku or any other PaaS (if possible, of course)."

I deployed this app on Google App Engine and it is currently hosted at gae-shoutbox.appspot.com.
